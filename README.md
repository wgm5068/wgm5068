Hi there, my name is Wilson Miller and I am a senior at The Pennsylvania State University with a graduation date of May 2022. 
I am currently studying Cyber Security Analytics and Operations with a focus in Geopolitics. At university I have used Java to develop many
different applications for my classes but have taken an interest in learning Python on my own. I am using this space to share projects that 
I have done specifically for my education and to showcase some of the projects that I am I working on in my free time.
